- Detect "as" imports and use information in the graph
  -> AST only
  -> This needs a number of tests as well (including test
     for from imports:
       - a: "from b import c", b: "import sys as c" [with correct link]
       - a: "from b import c", b: "from sys import path as c" [no link to 'c']
       - a: "from b import c", b: "from package import submod as c" [with correct link]
       - Both with abs. and rel. imports

- Add support for virtual environments (venv and virtualenv)
  [Tests for both, likely special support for virtualenv]

  -> Need tests (which need to use subprocesses), what can be tested?
     Venv should work fine, for virtualenv need to check for special
     files (os.py, distutils), verify that the dependencies are correct
     (and reflect the files outside of the virtual environment)

- Write documentation:
  - Document graph builder details
  - Add examples

- Test modules contain duplicated support code, moves that code
  to testsuite.util (test support mix-in)
