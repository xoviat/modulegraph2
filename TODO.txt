- Support relative imports in ModuleGraph
  -> First add test cases
  -> Then update the implementation

- Detect "as" imports and use information in the graph
- See XXX throughout
- Always use the stdlib implies (modulegraph._implies)
 (with option to disable)
- Add mechanism to provide names exported by extensions,
  and use this for the extensions in the stdlib
- Add mechanism the is called before creating
  a MissingModule node, and use this to implement
  support for SWIG (this should be a seperate module
  that is unconditionally used)
- Add support for setuptools style namespace packages
  (T.B.D. if this needs an extension hook)
- Code currently doesn't work with search path != sys.path
  (Alternate path is ignored, either fix or give up and
  don't support alternate paths. Only support alternate path
  when importlib does)
- Add support for virtual environments (venv and virtualenv)
- Add testcase with deep dependency graph
  (with artifial limitation of the recursion limit),
  should not just be a deeply nested package, chain of
  imports should do the trick)
- Write exporters:
  - dot file
  - HTML (using D3.js)

  -> Both: actual exporter works on ObjectGraph level,
     with hooks to customize node and edge L&F (text and attributes)
  -> Try to use the same hooks in both
  -> Also specific implementations for these hooks to use
     with ModuleGraph

- Check naming and adjust for readability
- Split of objectgraph to seperate PyPI package
- Write documentation:
  - Update reference docs
  - Add examples
- Write tests comparing output with older modulegraph
  (graph structure and dependencies)
- Integratie with py2app (experimental) to verify
  behaviour
- modulegraph2/_modulegraph.py is too large, try to
  move more code to utilities in other modules.



- Post to blog about this (with initial push to PyPI)
