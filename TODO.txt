- Code currenty tries to add edges more than once, why? (ModuleGraph)
- Support relative imports in ModuleGraph
- Proper support for 'from' imports
- A lot more ModuleGraph tests, that slowly add more
  functionality (to make it easier to debug issues and
  check that tests give the right test coverage)
- See XXX throughout
- Mypy annotations in _graphbuilder
- Merge the two ImportInfo definitions
- Missing support for relative imports
- Always use the stdlib implies
- Add mechanism to provide names exported by extensions,
  and use this for the extensions in the stdlib
- Add mechanism the is called before creating
  a MissingModule node, and use this to implement
  support for SWIG (this should be a seperate module
  that is unconditionally used)
- Add support for setuptools style namespace packages
  (T.B.D. if this needs an extension hook)
- Code currently doesn't work with search path != sys.path
  (Alternate path is ignored)
- Add support for virtual environments (venv and virtualenv)
- Add testcase with deep dependency graph
  (with artifial limitation of the recursion limit),
  should not just be a deeply nested package, chain of
  imports should do the trick)
- Write exporters:
  - dot file
  - HTML (using D3.js)
- Check naming and adjust for readability
- Write documentation:
  - Update reference docs
  - Add examples
