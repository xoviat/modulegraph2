- Detect "as" imports and use information in the graph
  -> AST only
  -> This needs a number of tests as well (including test
     for from imports:
       - a: "from b import c", b: "import sys as c" [with correct link]
       - a: "from b import c", b: "from sys import path as c" [no link to 'c']
       - a: "from b import c", b: "from package import submod as c" [with correct link]
       - Both with abs. and rel. imports

- Write documentation:
  - Document graph builder details
  - Add examples

- Test modules contain duplicated support code, moves that code
  to testsuite.util (test support mix-in)
